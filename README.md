# Combining the Power of Computer Vision & Inventory Management

The aim of this project is to build a preliminary computer vision application to measure size of objects on a plane.

The inspiration of the project came from my management science teacher and on further implementation, this turened out to be a unique project in terms of its  possible applications in the industry.

## Limitations : 
This code works only for a certain set of images which neet to be place in certain angle and position

## Future Possibility :
Currently, I am preparing a data set to combine the power of CNN based neural networks and this project to scale it up.


P.S. : I am open to more suggestions and respect every opinion. If you find any bugs in the existing codebase, do let me know via my email : code.pankajgupta@gmail.com or make a pull request if possible with the relevant changes.
